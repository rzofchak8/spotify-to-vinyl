## Current plan for future changes
---

1. self rate-limit because discogs api is very slow (60 requests per min)

2. 

6. webapp option instead of background process
*notes*: this would be more of a one-off process with your playlist, same idea but very different implementation

7. expand to multiple streaming platforms if realistic
