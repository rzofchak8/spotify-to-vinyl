## Current plan for future changes
---

1. self rate-limit because discogs api is very slow (60 requests per min)

2. transform to observer pattern so we only update on playlist change detected (is this possible?)

3. host backend essentially for query request, in order to hide the consumer keys
 - would signify the completion of initial idea

...
4. one-off webapp option instead of background process, essentially what this is leading towards

...
5. expand to multiple streaming platforms if realistic
 - would require refactoring of code
