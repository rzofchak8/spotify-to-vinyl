## Current plan for future changes
---

1. transform to observer pattern so we only update on playlist change detected (is this possible?)

2. implement script to start on startup
 - would require observer pattern to be completed

3. host backend essentially for query request, in order to hide the consumer keys
 - would signify the completion of initial idea

4. (optional) multi-playlist tracking?

pivoting...
5. one-off webapp option instead of background process, essentially what this is leading towards

...
6. expand to multiple streaming platforms if realistic
 - would require refactoring of code, not like it needs it already
